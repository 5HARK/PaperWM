* Mutter signal order 
** When window A is closed
  - The next window, B, receives 'focus' (but the actor of A seems to be gone?)
  - Workspace receives 'window-removed'. ('A' seems to have been stripped of signal handlers)
** When window A is created  
   1. on workspace "window-added" is run, actor isn't available
   2. on display "window-created is run, actor is available
   3. focus is run if the new window should be focused
* TODO Generalize to work with more workspaces

eg.
workspaces[index] = {
  windows:  [],
  focus: n,
}

* TODO Move initial positioning into window-created signal
Don't scale new windows
* TODO Hook up resize/move functionality
* TODO More keybindings, eg. meta-<number>
* TODO Simple scratchpad 
Probably easiest/best to 
* TODO Window search
* TODO Scaling bug
Possible fix: hide the actual window and replace it with a clone, which only sets focus on click
* TODO General animation consistency
* TODO Better alt-tab
